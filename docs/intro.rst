IBM Analytic Engine
--------------------

IBM Analytics Engine provides an architecture for Hadoop clusters 
that decouples the compute and storage tiers. Instead of a permanent 
cluster formed of dual-purpose nodes, the Analytics Engine allows 
users to store data in an object storage layer such as IBM Cloud Object 
Storage and spins up clusters of compute notes when needed. Separating 
compute from storage helps to transform the flexibility, scalability 
and maintainability of big data analytics platforms.
